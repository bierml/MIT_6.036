I was unable to do this homework on my machine (tensorflow running on my CPU is too slow), so I used Collab notebook to test code. My versions of code got 100% in tests but did not run in Collab, so I forked this notebook: https://github.com/TangJiahui/6.036_Machine_Learning/blob/main/MIT_6_036_HW10_Reinforcement_Learning.ipynb
My fork contains corrected by myself link for wget (CAT-SOOP's link does not work correctly) and corrected code (it did not work with last zip from the site, so I used my own implementation of update in NNQ). All other things were not changed by me and stayed as they were written by the author of the repo. My versions of all the functions for this homework you can find in mdp10.py (but I give no warranty they will work for Part 4 questions).
